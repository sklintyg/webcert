/**
 * Extracts the List of individual {@link Exchange}s that have been aggregated during the last minute and lets
 * the {@link NotificationMessageDiscardFilter} filter out those not applicable to be forwarded to the
 * notificationQueue.
 *
 * Note that this processor returns a List of messages as its output - typically the next processor should be a standard
 * camel "split" Processor that splits the List into its individual messages and then forwards them to the
 * notificationQueue, i.e:
 *
 * M(1...n) -> Aggregator (this) -> M(List of 1...n messages) -> Split -> M(1...n)
